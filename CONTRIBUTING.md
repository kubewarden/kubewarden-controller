## Requirements

The following tools are required to build and run this project:

- **Docker**: for building and running containerized workloads.
- **Go**: required by the `audit-scanner` and `controller` components.
- **Rust**: required by the `policy-server` and `kwctl` components. The exact version and required
  targets are defined in `rust-toolchain.toml`.
- **[cross](https://github.com/cross-rs/cross)**: required to cross-compile Rust code for different architectures.
- **Make**: the build tool controlling various build tasks.
- **[Tilt](https://docs.tilt.dev/)**: a development tool for multi-service applications.
- **Kubernetes cluster**: a running Kubernetes cluster, used for development. [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/)
  or a similar solution.
- **[Helm](https://helm.sh/)**: required for deploying and testing charts.

## Code Layout

The repository is organized as follows:

- `charts`: contains the Helm charts for managing deployments.
- `cmd`: main entry points for the `audit-scanner` and `kubewarden-controller` executables.
- `crates`: all Rust components of the project.
- `docs`: developer-focused documentation and README files for various components.
- `e2e`: end-to-end tests. A real Kubernetes cluster is created using Docker and Kind.
- `internal`: contains the entire Go codebase.

## Linting and Formatting

### Go

Format Go code:

```console
make fmt-go
```

Run the Go linter ([golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run/)):

```console
make lint-go
```

Automatically fix linting issues when possible:

```console
make lint-go-fix
```

### Rust

Check Rust code formatting:

```console
make fmt-rust
```

Run the Rust linter (clippy):

```console
make lint-rust
```

Automatically fix linting issues when possible:

```console
make lint-rust-fix
```

### Security Auditing

Check Rust dependencies for known security vulnerabilities using [cargo-deny](https://embarkstudios.github.io/cargo-deny/):

```console
make advisories-rust
```

## Building

### Build All Components

Build all components (controller, audit-scanner, policy-server, kwctl):

```console
make all
```

### Build Individual Components

Build only the Go components:

```console
make controller
make audit-scanner
```

Build only the Rust components:

```console
make policy-server
make kwctl
```

### Build Container Images

Build Docker images for each component:

```console
make controller-image
make audit-scanner-image
make policy-server-image
```

You can customize the registry, repository, and tag using environment variables:

```console
make controller-image REGISTRY=ghcr.io REPO=your-username TAG=dev
```

## Development

To run the controller for development purposes, you can use [Tilt](https://tilt.dev/).

### Settings

The `tilt-settings.yaml.example` acts as a template for the `tilt-settings.yaml`
file that you need to create in the root of this repository. Copy the example
file and edit it to match your environment. The `tilt-settings.yaml` file is
ignored by git, so you can edit it without concern about committing it by
mistake.

The following settings can be configured:

- `registry`: the container registry to push the controller image to. If you
  don't have a private registry, you can use `ghcr.io` provided your cluster has
  access to it.

- `audit-scanner`: the name of the audit-scanner image. If you are using `ghcr.io` as your
  registry, you need to prefix the image name with your GitHub username.

- `controller`: the name of the controller image. If you are using `ghcr.io` as your
  registry, you need to prefix the image name with your GitHub username.

- `policy-server`: the name of the policy-server image. If you are using `ghcr.io` as your
  registry, you need to prefix the image name with your GitHub username.

Example:

```yaml
registry: ghcr.io
audit-scanner: your-github-username/kubewarden/audit-scanner
controller: your-github-username/kubewarden/controller
policy-server: your-github-username/kubewarden/policy-server
```

### Running

The `Tiltfile` included in this repository takes care of the following:

- Creates the `kubewarden` namespace.
- Installs the `kubewarden-crds` and `kubewarden-controller` Helm charts from the `charts` folder.
- Injects the development images into the running Pods.
- Automatically reloads the controller/audit-scanner/policy-server when you make changes to the code.

To run the controller, you just need to run the following command against an
empty cluster:

```console
tilt up
```

Use the web interface of Tilt to monitor the log streams of the different components and,
if needed, manually trigger restarts.

## Changes to CRDs

After changing a CRD, run the following command:

```console
make generate
```

This will:

- Update all the generated Go code
- Update the CRDs shipped by our Helm chart

## Testing

### Running Tests

Run all unit tests, regardless of the language:

```console
make test
```

Run e2e tests:

```console
make test-e2e
```

### Helm Chart Tests

Run Helm chart unit tests:

```console
make helm-unittest
```

### Writing (controller) integration tests

The controller integration tests are written using the [Ginkgo](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/)
and [Gomega](https://onsi.github.io/gomega/) testing frameworks.
The tests are located in the `internal/controller` package.

By default, the tests are run using [envtest](https://book.kubebuilder.io/reference/envtest), which
sets up an instance of etcd and the Kubernetes API server, without kubelet, controller-manager, or other components.

However, some tests require a real Kubernetes cluster to run.
These tests are defined under the `e2e` folder using the [e2e-framework](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/e2e-framework).

The suite setup will start a cluster using [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) and run the tests against it.
It will also stop and remove the container when the tests finish.

Note that the `e2e` tests are slower than the `envtest` tests; therefore, it is recommended to keep their number to a minimum.
An example of a test that requires a real cluster is the `AdmissionPolicy` test suite, since at the time of writing, we wait for the `PolicyServer` Pod to be ready before reconciling the webhook configuration.

### Focusing on Specific Tests

You can focus on a specific test or spec by using a [Focused Spec](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/#focused-specs).

Example:

```go
var _ = Describe("Controller test", func() {
    FIt("should do something", func() {
        // This spec will be the only one executed
    })
})
```

## Releasing

1. Check that `:latest` builds of kubewarden-controller for main are fine, including kwctl
1. Edit latest _draft_ release in https://github.com/kubewarden/kubewarden-controller/releases
   Change its title to contain the correct version (e.g: 1.32.0-rc1)
1. Open an automated release PR with https://github.com/kubewarden/kubewarden-controller/actions/workflows/open-release-pr.yml
1. Review & merge automated PR
1. Tag version in kubewarden-controller repo
1. Wait for images to be built, so e2e tests can work
1. Trigger automated PR that syncs adm controller charts with helm-chart repo
   https://github.com/kubewarden/helm-charts/actions/workflows/update-adm-controller.yaml
1. Merge automated PR on helm-chart repo
1. chart-releaser releases the charts on Helm chart repo.

## Additional Resources

- **Developer Documentation**: The `docs/` folder contains additional documentation for each component
  (`audit-scanner`, `controller`, `kwctl`, `policy-server`, and `crds`).
- **RFCs**: Design proposals and architectural decisions are tracked in a separate repository at
  <https://github.com/kubewarden/rfc>.
