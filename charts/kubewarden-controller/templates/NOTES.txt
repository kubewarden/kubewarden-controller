You can now start defining admission policies by using the cluster-wide
`clusteradmissionpolicies.policies.kubewarden.io` or the namespaced
`admissionpolicies.policies.kubewarden.io` resources.

⚠️  **Upgrade notice: RBAC resource consolidation**

Starting with this release, all controller RBAC permissions have been
consolidated into a single ClusterRole and a single Role, simplifying the
permission model. The following resources from previous versions are no longer
used and should be manually deleted after a successful upgrade:

  kubectl delete clusterrole kubewarden-controller-manager-cluster-role
  kubectl delete clusterrole kubewarden-controller-proxy-role
  kubectl delete clusterrolebinding kubewarden-controller-manager-cluster-role
  kubectl delete clusterrolebinding kubewarden-controller-proxy-rolebinding
  kubectl delete rolebinding kubewarden-controller-leader-election-rolebinding -n {{ .Release.Namespace }}
  kubectl delete rolebinding kubewarden-controller-manager-namespaced-rolebinding -n {{ .Release.Namespace }}
  kubectl delete role kubewarden-controller-leader-election-role -n {{ .Release.Namespace }}
  kubectl delete role kubewarden-controller-manager-namespaced-role -n {{ .Release.Namespace }}
{{- end }}
